# FTC 8404 Sample Detection
- Limelight neural detector trained to detect yellow, red, and blue samples
- 8000+ samples
- 50+ hours spent labelling


Improvements over OpenCV:
- Separation between adjacent samples
- Reliable in various lighting conditions
- Reliable at different camera angles

## Usage
Upload the model in `content/final_output` to your Limelight. You may have to tweak exposure and balance settings to make it work optimally.
